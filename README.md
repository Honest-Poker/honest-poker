# Honest Poker
An 11 month long endeavour to build a web based multiplayer poker game in VR. It's called Honest Poker because I probably won't build any logic to prevent players from cheating!

The goal of this project is to improve my JavaScript knowledge and make use of the tools, technologies and techniques that I learn throughout 2021.
